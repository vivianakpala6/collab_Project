Future Destination is a 3D first-person exploration project. My partner and I created three scenes representing Italy and two perspectives of Korea.
The player moves using WASD or arrow keys and presses 'C' to switch scenes. 
We used Unity assets to add movement, characters, and environmental details for an immersive experience.
